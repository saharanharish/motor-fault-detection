# motor-fault-detection
DC Motor Speed Control with Fault Detection â€” A Python simulation of a PID-controlled DC motor with injected mechanical faults (load torque &amp; increased friction) and automated fault detection via speed error thresholding. Includes full modelling, control, detection, and visualization.
